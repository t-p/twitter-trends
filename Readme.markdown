## today's twitter trends
* * *
This Sinatra application shows what's current trend in twitter.  
Trends are restricted to Germany only. I use the twitter gem to  
access the api provided by Twitter. Twitter delivers the data using  
JSON, which is displayed by this application using haml for the  
view. In my css, I use the 960 grid system. The reason I wrote this  
app is because I wanted to get familiar with the twitter api for  
further use.  

Check out the running application.
